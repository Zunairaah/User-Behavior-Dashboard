Hi, Iâ€™m Zunaira Hameed! Iâ€™ve started learning PlotlyDash and I've created my first project in Plotly Dash dashboard to analyze user behavior based on mobile phone usage. The dashboard provides basic insights into screen time, app usage, and how these factors vary with age and gender. ðŸ“±

While the design is simple, it helps users easily visualize their mobile usage patterns and explore trends in an intuitive way.

This project gave me the opportunity to apply my skills in data analysis and interactive visualizations. Iâ€™d appreciate your feedback!
